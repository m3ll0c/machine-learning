# 🤖 machine-learning

Welcome to my **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** repository! This space serves as a personal collection of practical implementations, solutions to exercises, and projects covering a wide range of ML and DL topics.

This repository is a log of my journey through AI, intended for learning, practice, and reference. You'll find implementations of classic algorithms (often from scratch) as well as applications using popular libraries.


## 📖 About This Repository

This collection includes a variety of topics, from the fundamentals of data preprocessing and simple linear regression to more complex neural network architectures for computer vision and NLP.

**The main goals of this repository are to:**
* Implement and understand common algorithms.
* Solve practical exercises from courses, books, and real-world problems.
* Build a portfolio of hands-on data science projects.
* Serve as a "cookbook" for common ML/DL tasks and code snippets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The exercises and projects in this repository primarily use the following technologies:

* **Language:** Python 3.12+
* **Core Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow 2.x, Keras
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) & Python Scripts (.py)
